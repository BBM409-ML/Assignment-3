Our aim is to predict whether an e-mail is a spam or not using the naive bayes model. This report shows steps we have followed, code implementations and analysis of results for naive bayes algorithm."

The Naive Bayes algorithm is quick and simple to implement, but the necessity that predictors be independent is its major drawback."

    "Machine learning algorithms classify data using statistical models. In the instance of spam detection, a trained machine learning model must be able to tell if the sequence of words in an email is more similar to spam emails or not. Different machine learning methods can detect spam, in this assignment we use Naive Bayes. The \"Bayes' theorem,\" which describes the likelihood of an event dependent on prior knowledge, is the foundation of nave Bayes. The problem is that our characteristics aren't always self-contained.

    "Consider the words \"not\" and \"interesting\", in this situation, depending on where they appear in the message, the meaning can be radically different. Despite the fact that feature independence in text data is difficult to achieve, the Naive Bayes classifier has proven to be effective in natural language processing applications when correctly configured. In the following sections, it is going to be tested and interpreted whether Naive Bayes is succesful on email spam detection."

    "Naive Bayes, like other machine learning algorithms, does not understand linguistic context and instead relies on statistical relationships between words to determine whether a piece of text belongs to a specific class. This means that a naive Bayes spam detector, for example, can be fooled into missing a spam email if the sender simply adds some non-spam words at the end of the message or replaces spammy terms with closely related words."

On the other hand, classifying e-mails based on only words can be problematic due to the deficit of context interpretation."

This problem can be eliminated by using Laplace Smoothing also known as Add One Smoothing when alpha is 1. In this technique, we add 1 to the numerator, and we add k to the denominator. So, in the case that we donâ€™t have a particular ingredient in our training set, the posterior probability comes out to 1 / N + k instead of zero. Plugging in this value into the product does not destroy our ability to make a prediction in the same way that plugging in a zero does."
